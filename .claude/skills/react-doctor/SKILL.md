# React Doctor

Scans React codebases for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues. Outputs a 0–100 health score.

## Requested or repository-required regression scan

Run the repository's configured React Doctor command when present. Otherwise use `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --diff` for a requested scan. Do not start a scan merely because React code changed.

If the score dropped, fix the regressions before committing.

## Requested full React Doctor cleanup

Run `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose` (without `--diff`) to scan the full codebase. Fix issues by severity — errors first, then warnings.

## /doctor — full local triage workflow

When the user types `/doctor`, says "run react doctor", or asks for a full triage / cleanup pass (not just a regression check), fetch the canonical local-triage playbook and follow every step in it:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  --header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  https://www.react.doctor/prompts/react-doctor-agent.md
```

The playbook is the single source of truth — a scan → filter → triage → fix → validate loop that edits the working tree directly (never commits, never opens PRs). Updating the prompt at its source updates every agent on its next fetch — no skill reinstall needed.

Pair it with the matching per-rule prompts at `https://www.react.doctor/prompts/rules/<plugin>/<rule>.md` (fetched on demand inside the playbook) so each fix uses the canonical, reviewer-tested recipe.

## Command

```bash
npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --diff
```

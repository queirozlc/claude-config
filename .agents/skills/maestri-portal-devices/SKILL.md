# Maestri Mobile Device Automation

You're running inside Maestri, a spatial development workspace that connects AI agents, terminals, notes, and browser portals on a visual canvas.
The `maestri` CLI is a command-line executable pre-installed and available on PATH. If `maestri` is not found, use `"$MAESTRI_CLI"` instead; this environment variable always points to the full binary path.

Device portals are embedded mobile devices on the Maestri canvas: an **iOS simulator**, an **Android emulator**, or a **physical Android phone** over adb. You can automate them to tap, type, scroll, press hardware buttons, launch apps, and read the accessibility tree. A device portal is a Portal node, so it takes the same `maestri portal` commands as a browser portal.

Portal name is always required. Run `maestri list` to see connected portal names.

## Opening a device

`maestri portal devices` — list every device this Mac can drive, grouped by OS version, with whether each is booted and whether a portal already holds it.

```
iOS 26.5
  iPhone 17 Pro  [5AFEC770-…]  — booted, in use by "Checkout"
  iPad Pro 13-inch (M5)  [3B82A9C3-…]  — free
Android 16
  Pixel 9  [emulator-5554]  — booted, free
  Pixel 8  [39affe1a]  — physical device, connected, free
Android emulators
  Pixel Tablet  [Pixel_Tablet]  — free
```

A UUID is iOS; `emulator-5554` or a bare serial is Android. Devices grouped under **Android emulators** start when a portal opens on them, which takes a while. A physical device is usable while it's plugged in.

`maestri portal create --simulator <id> ["Name"]` — open a portal on a device and connect it to your terminal. Adopt one marked **free**.

```
maestri portal create --simulator 3B82A9C3-… "Layout check"
```

A device runs once however many portals point at it, so adopting one that's `in use` shares its screen with another agent. Creating and deleting devices belongs to the user: iOS simulators in Maestri's **New Portal** sheet, Android emulators in Android Studio's Device Manager. When nothing on the list suits, ask.

## Snapshot & Refs

The **snapshot** command is the most important — it returns the frontmost app's accessibility tree with **refs** (`@e1`, `@e2`...) that you use as selectors for every other command:

```
maestri portal snapshot "Sim"
```

Returns something like:
```
app: Safari  screen: 393x852pt  elements: 24
@e1 button "Back" [8,60 44x44]
@e2 field "Address" value="apple.com" [60,60 273x40] *focused*
@e3 button "Reload" [345,60 40x40]
@e12 cell "Top Stories" [0,320 393x120]
```

**Selectors** — commands that take one accept:
- `@e3` — ref from snapshot (most reliable)
- `196,430` — x,y coordinates

Coordinates in the tree and in `info` are screen points. Snapshots wait for the UI to settle, so the state you read is current.

On iOS an app exposes a tree when **Maestri launched it**: the accessibility agent is injected at launch, into that process only. For an app started by Xcode, by a build tool, or by tapping its icon, run `maestri portal launch "Sim" <bundle-id>` to bring it under Maestri and get a tree. That's also the command to reach for whenever snapshot returns a screenshot instead of a tree — the header's `accessibility:` line names the reason, and in that mode you tap by pixel coordinates read straight off the returned image, which is captured at the resolution the tap expects.

### Embedded web content

When a web view is on screen — a React Native `WebView`, Capacitor/Ionic, or a native app showing a login or checkout page — the page's elements join the same tree, continuing the same ref sequence, and the header says `(includes web content)`:

```
app: com.example.shop  screen: 402x874pt  elements: 12  (includes web content)
@e1 text "Checkout" [163,74 76x21]
@e3 a "First link" href=https://example.com/one [8,219 58x19]
@e6 input "Search field" type=text [8,243 154x20]
```

Web lines carry the browser portal's extra detail (`href=`, `type=`, `options=[…]`, `checked`, `disabled`) and cover same-origin iframes. Their coordinates are already device screen points, so `click @e6` behaves exactly as it does on a native element.

## Commands

### Interaction
- `maestri portal click "Sim" @e3` — tap the element's center
- `maestri portal click "Sim" 196,430` — tap x,y coordinates
- `maestri portal type "Sim" "hello world"` — type into the focused field (tap a field first to focus it)
- `maestri portal key "Sim" "Enter"` — press a key (Enter/Return, Tab, Space, Backspace, Escape, Up/Down/Left/Right)
- `maestri portal scroll "Sim" down 400` — swipe-scroll up/down/left/right by an amount
- `maestri portal swipe "Sim" @e3 @e9` — drag between two points; each end is `@ref` or `"x,y"`
- `maestri portal button "Sim" home` — press a hardware button (`home`, `lock`, `side`)

### Resizable iOS apps

iOS 27 lets an app run at an arbitrary size on a separate "Resizable" display. Maestri drives
this with Apple's `devicectl device appResize` and moves the portal onto that display, so the
portal's width and height follow the app. It needs the CoreDevice tools installed by Xcode 27
or later and a simulator on an iOS 27 runtime; older runtimes have no resizable display.

- `maestri portal resize "Sim" status` — one `key: value` line per fact: `available` (the tool
  exists), `runtime`, `resizable_display` (found on the connected simulator or not), `active`,
  `preferred_size`, and the display inventory. Read this first when a resize fails.
- `maestri portal resize "Sim" 800 600` — start a session at 800x600, or change the size of the
  active one. Whole numbers from 100 to 4096. The foreground app must support resizing; Apple's
  tool refuses otherwise and the refusal is returned as the error. The size is a request: the
  `ok:` line and `achieved_size` in status report what the app actually got, which is smaller
  when the app enforces its own limits.
- `maestri portal resize "Sim" stop` — end the session and return the portal to the device screen.

Bring the app to the front (`launch`) before starting. After every resize or stop, take a new
snapshot: element refs and coordinates from before are stale. Only one portal can own a
simulator's resize session at a time; unloading or closing the portal ends it. A failed resize
exits nonzero with the reason. Android portals do not support these commands. Changing
`DEVELOPER_DIR` in a terminal does not change what the running Maestri uses.

### Apps & lifecycle
- `maestri portal launch "Sim" com.apple.mobilesafari` — launch an app by bundle id
- `maestri portal terminate "Sim" com.apple.mobilesafari` — kill an app
- `maestri portal navigate "Sim" "https://example.com"` — open a URL through the device's URL handler
- `maestri portal screenshot "Sim"` — capture a PNG (returns temp file path)
- `maestri portal info "Sim"` — device name, runtime, state, display size, and the `udid` on its first line
- `maestri portal boot "Sim"` / `shutdown "Sim"` — power the device on or off

### Android
Everything above works the same on Android. Four things differ:

- **`key` gains the navigation keys**: `back`, `recents`, `menu`, `volumeup`, `volumedown`. `maestri portal key "Pixel" back` is how you go back, since there's no on-screen button to tap.
- **`launch` takes a package name** rather than a bundle id: `maestri portal launch "Pixel" com.example.app`.
- **`snapshot` takes about two seconds**, because it uses the platform's `uiautomator`. A repeat snapshot on an unchanged screen is free, since the answer is reused.
- **A drag is delivered as a completed swipe.** `scroll` works normally; gestures that depend on holding mid-drag, like pulling a notification shade partway, aren't expressible over adb.

Android reports `resource-id` as `id=…`, the same field iOS uses for accessibility identifiers, so targeting by id works identically on both.

## Recommended Workflow

1. `maestri portal snapshot "Sim"` — read the screen and get refs
2. Use refs to interact: `click @e2`, then `type "..."`, then `key "Enter"`
3. `maestri portal snapshot "Sim"` again to verify the result
4. If refs are stale (the screen changed), run snapshot again to get fresh ones

Use `screenshot` when you need to see the visual layout. Use `snapshot` when you need to understand interactive elements. Prefer `snapshot` + refs over `screenshot` + coordinates — refs are more accurate.

A device portal survives workspace and floor switches, and several can run at once.

## Building an app and running it here

Pass the portal's device to the build tool, or it picks a device of its own and you drive one your build never reached. `maestri portal info "Sim"` gives the `udid`.

**React Native / Expo.** `<runner>` is a placeholder: use whatever the repo uses (a `package.json` script, `bun x`, `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`, `npx`, a bare `expo`), which the lockfile and `packageManager` field tell you. Only the flags matter.

```
<runner> expo run:ios --device <udid>       # or: <runner> react-native run-ios --udid <udid>
maestri portal launch "Sim" <bundle-id>    # Expo launches the app itself, so relaunch for a tree
maestri portal snapshot "Sim"
```

`testID` arrives in the tree as `id=…`, so target those rather than labels that copy changes break. After a JS edit, Fast Refresh reloads in place and the tree stays live. A native change (a new native module, a pod install) needs a rebuild, which relaunches the app.

On Android it's the same shape, and injection isn't involved at all, so no relaunch is needed:

```
<runner> expo run:android --device <emulator-5554>
maestri portal snapshot "Pixel"
```

**Native Swift / SwiftUI.** Ask the build system for the bundle id and product path:

```
xcodebuild -scheme App -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<udid>' -showBuildSettings \
  | grep -E "PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER|TARGET_BUILD_DIR|WRAPPER_NAME"
```

```
xcodebuild -scheme App -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<udid>' -derivedDataPath .build build
xcrun simctl install <udid> .build/Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/App.app
maestri portal launch "Sim" <bundle-id>
maestri portal snapshot "Sim"
```

Relaunch with `maestri portal launch` rather than `simctl launch`: it injects the agent, waits until the app answers, and remembers the bundle so later snapshots describe this app. Every native edit repeats rebuild → install → relaunch.
